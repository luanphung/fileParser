Description:
This project is to find if a list of elements are present in files of a folder.

The input is given by the user as a list of elements in a .txt file.
Every single element are on a line for the input file.

The second input is the directory in which you want to search all the elements.

The third input is the name of the file you want to have as output.

The fourth and final input is the directory in which the file will be created in.


The output file should be a csv file created in a directory specified by the user and also the name of the file is specified by the user.

I haven't completed the exception handling part, meaning that if you make a mistake in either of the inputs except the name of the file, you will get an 
error message.
